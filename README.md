# Hanson_Nacewicz_Frontiers_Amygdala_Review_Data

This is a barebones csv files noting studies described in:

Hanson, J. L., & Nacewicz, B. M. (2021). Amygdala Allostasis and Early Life Adversity: Considering Excitotoxicity and Inescapability in the Sequelae of Stress. Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 15.

The csv file contains multiple columns that are useful for conceptualizing relations between adversity and the amygdala, including:
-Effect Size (Cohen's d, with 95% confidence intervals)

-Age range of study participants (mean and standard deviation)

-Direction of effect (smaller/larger volumes)

-Type of adversity/stress examined

-Citation of the study

-Sample size of the study


We believe that ELA aggravates an exhaustive cycle of amygdala expansion and subsequent toxic-metabolic damage (best viewed through an "allostatic load" lens). full text paper is located here: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.624705/full
